=== ContainersCAFE ===

</pre>

ContainerCAFE is an extension of the [CloudCAFE Framework](https://github.com/stackforge) specifically designed to test deployed
versions of Rackspace's Containers product. It is built using the [Open CAFE Core](https://github.com/stackforge) and [CloudCAFE](https://github.com/stackforge)

Supported Operating Systems
---------------------------
ContainerCAFE has been developed primarily in Linux and MAC environments, however, it supports installation and
execution on Windows

Installation
------------
ContainerCAFE can be [installed with pip](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pip) from the git repository after it is cloned to a local machine.

* First follow the README instructions to install [CloudCAFE](https://github.com/stackforge)
* Clone this repository to your local machine
* CD to the root directory in your cloned repository.
* Run "[sudo] pip install . --upgrade" and pip will auto install all other dependencies.

Configuration
--------------
ContainerCAFE works in tandem with the [Open CAFE Core](https://github.com/stackforge) cafe-runner.

To use ContainerCAFE you **will need to create/install your own configurations** based on the reference configs pointing to your containers and their hosts

At this stage you will have the Open CAFE Core engine. From this point you are ready to:
1) Write entirely new tests using the OpenCafe Framework

Logging
-------
ContainerCAFE leverages the logging capabilities of the CAFE Core engine. If tests are executed with the built-in cafe-runner, runtime logs will be output
to <USER_HOME>/.opencafe/logs/<PRODUCT>/<CONFIGURATION>/<TIME_STAMP>. In addition, tests built from the built-in CAFE unittest driver will generate
csv statistics files in <USER_HOME>/.opencafe/logs/<PRODUCT>/<CONFIGURATION>/statistics for each and ever execution of each and every test case that
provides metrics of execution over time for elapsed time, pass/fail rates, etc...

Basic ContainerCAFE Package Anatomy
-------------------------------
Below is a short description of the top level ContainersCAFE Packages.

##containercafe
This is the root package for all things ContainerCAFE.

##common
Contains modules that extend the CAFE Core engine specific to OpenStack. This is the primary namespace for tools, data generators, common
reporting classes, etc...

##configs
Configuration files that are needed to run automated tests.
